# php-oops-arithmetic-operations


This code is an example of object-oriented programming (OOP) in PHP. Specifically, it demonstrates the use of classes, objects, properties, and methods to perform simple arithmetic operations (addition and subtraction).
The class Calculation serves as a blueprint for creating objects that can perform addition and subtraction. Each object (e.g., $c1 and $c2) represents a specific calculation with its own set of input values ($a and $b).

The methods sum() and sub() are responsible for performing the addition and subtraction operations, respectively, and returning the results.

Overall, this code illustrates the principles of encapsulation, where data and methods related to a specific functionality are encapsulated within a class, promoting code organization and reusability.
